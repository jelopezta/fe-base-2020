# Dedications

I dedicate this little project to:

1. The _God of Magick_, in whatever form and name he might take. Hail, Hermes!
2. The _Prince of Darkness_, in whatever form and name he might take. Hail, _Horned Lord_!
3. Myself, and the Black Flame that burns inside me and makes it possible for me to get inspired and do magick.
